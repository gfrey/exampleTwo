A website written in noir.

lein deps
lein run

build tool. Go to the [welcome page](http://localhost:8080/welcome) after the ```lein
run``` part.

This is just a toy website doing the following:

 - starting a stupiddb instance
 - allowing registration of new users (username & password)
 - allowing validation of users
 
It is simple and serves no purpose.
